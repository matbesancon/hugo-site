Last weeks have been pretty intense. I officially left Equisense and  started
a joined PhD project between INRIA Lille and Ã‰cole Polytechnique Montreal.
I had been preparing for this fresh start for several months and also wanted
to evolve in my content creation process.

## A journey from plain markdown to Hugo

I started writing articles to keep track of my learning paths on various topics,
including numerical techniques, data analysis and programming. My first articles
were either hand-written or RMarkdown-generated Markdown files on a GitHub repository.

As I was slowly moving from R to Python, Jupyter notebook became pretty handy
to mix paragraphs, code snippets, results and charts. It also forced me to
quit declaring and modifying variables, an annoying habit got from always
having a REPL and text editor bundled in most scientific computing IDEs
(Matlab, Scilab, RStudio, Jupyter).

Great, the articles were not centralized though but split into their GitHub
repositories, you have to admit this is not the most user-friendly browsing
experience. I found several blogs running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
and I decided to give it a try. For someone who is not fond of struggles with
front-end side layout issues, this was a true gift, I could easily reuse
templates from front-end developers and designers (special thanks for the
awesome [Gravity project](http://hemangsk.github.io/Gravity))
without much struggle and focus on what I liked: building projects and
writing content.

## Switching to THE writing platform

I kept maintaining the Jekyll blog until almost exactly one year ago. During
that time, I was mostly writing in the context of a side-project or thinking on
our journey at [Equisense](https://www.equisense.com). This raised new
requirements for the writing process such as collaborative writing, review from
friends, seeing the overall picture we were sending as a team from the sum of
our articles.

For these reasons, my articles gradually switched to Medium,
first published as an individual, then on the
[Equisense page](https://medium.com/equisense). This was a very productive time
for writing as we encouraged one another and had a direct impact on the way we
presented the team, how we work and our learning path: an invaluable tool to
help candidates decide whether the company was a fit for them and to ease the
onboading.

## If Medium works, why would anyone go back to writing everything from scratch?

I really enjoy the writing experience on Medium, with some drawbacks.
Medium's design is very opinionated, that's a part of what makes it a experience.
However, leaving some choices on key topics is essential (at least to me) on the
content-creation side.
I believe this should be the case on any two-sided platform:
**be opinionated on the user-side, leave flexibility on the creator side.**

The perfect example is the bright screen. It ensures the Medium experience is
consistent with the unique font, background etc... But writing on a dark screen
is a lot more comfortable, especially when you're used to it or when your eyes
are more light-sensitive: writing late in the evening or early in the morning
was not conceivable to me on the Medium interface. The hack I used was to write
everything on [Atom](https://atom.io), then paste everything to Medium once the
first draft was ready, still a bit of a pain.

This might seem minor as a reason to switch, but the root behind it is more
essential: **Medium is a platform, you're therefore a user, not an owner**.
Despite its global success, the company is still young and looking for the
right model. Nothing tells me the model they choose tomorrow will be one I
want to contribute to (how paid content will be managed for instance).
Switching platforms for written content is a lot more tedious than choosing well
at the beginning. This new step in my professional and personal life is the
perfect occasion to rethink that commitment, I will still be re-publishing
content to Medium, but not as the primary source.
