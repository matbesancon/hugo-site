## A complete predictive modeling project in Python
Part I: Preprocessing and exploratory analysis

One of the amazing things with data science is the ability to tackle
complex problems involving hidden parallel phenomena interacting with each
other, just from the data they produce.

As an example, we will use data extracted from images of forged and genuine
banknotes. The distinction between the two categories would be thought to
require a deep domain expertise, which limits the ability to check
more than a few banknotes at a time. An automated and trustable test would
be of interest for many businesses, governments and organizations.

Starting from the data provided by H. DÃ¶rsken and
Volker Lohweg, from the University of Applied Science of Ostwestfalen-Lippe,
Germany on the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication),
we will follow key steps of a data science project to build a performant, yet
scalable classifier.

The dataset was built by applying a wavelet
transform on images of banknotes to extract 4 features:

* Variance, skewness, kurtosis of the wavelet transform (respectively second,
third and fourth moment of the distribution).

* Entropy of the image, which can be interpreted as the amount of information
or randomness (which is represented by how different adjacent pixels are).

You can find further information on Wavelet on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_transform)
or ask [Quora](https://www.quora.com/In-an-intuitive-explanation-what-is-a-wavelet-transform-and-how-does-it-work-in-an-image).
An explanation of entropy as meant in the image processing context can
be found [here](http://www.astro.cornell.edu/research/projects/compression/entropy.html).

To get a better understanding of the way the algorithms works,
the full model will be built from scratch or almost (not using a machine
learning library like scikit-learn on Python or caret on R).

Basic statistic notions (variance, linear regression) and some basic python
knowledge is recommended to follow through the three articles.

## Programming choices and libraries

### Language and environment
Python, which is a great
compromise between practicality (with handy data format and manipulation)
and scalability (much easier to implement for large scale, automated
computation than R, Octave or Matlab). More precisely, Python 3.5.1 with
the Anaconda distribution 2.4.0, I personally use the Spyder environment
but feel free to keep your favorite tools.

### Libraries
* Collections (built-in) for occurrence counting
* numpy 1.10.1, providing key data format, mathematical manipulation techniques.
* scipy 0.16.0, imported here for the distance matrix computation and the stat submodule for Quantile-Quantile plots.
* pandas 0.17.1 for advanced data format, high-level manipulation and visualization
* pyplot from matplotlib 1.5.0 for basic visualization
* ggplot 0.6.8, which I think is a much improved way to visualize data
* urllib3 to parse the data directly from the repository (no manual download)

So our first lines of code (once you placed your data in the proper repository)
should look like this:

{{< highlight python >}}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import ggplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats
import scipy.spatial.distance
from collections import Counter
import urllib3
{{< /highlight >}}

### Source files

The source files will be available on the corresponding Github repository.
These include:
* preprocess.py to load the data and libraries
* exploratory.py for preliminary visualization
* feature_eng.py where the data will be transformed to boost the model performance
* model_GLM.py where we define key functions and build our model
* model.py where we will visualize characteristics of the model

# Dataset overview and exploratory analysis

Understanding intuitive phenomena in the data and test its underlying structure
are the objectives for this first (usually long) phase of a data science
project, especially if you were not involved in the data collection process.

## Data parsing

Instead of manually downloading the data and placing it in our project
repository, we will download using the *urllib3* library.

{{< highlight python >}}
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00267/data_banknote_authentication.txt"
http = urllib3.PoolManager()
r = http.request('GET',url)
with open("data_banknote_authentication.txt",'wb') as f:
  f.write(r.data)
r.release_conn()
data0 = pd.read_csv("data_banknote_authentication.txt",
  names=["vari","skew","kurtosis","entropy","class"])
{{< /highlight >}}

## Key statistics and overview

Since the data were loaded using pandas, key methods of the DataFrame
object can be used to find some key information in the data.

{{< highlight python >}}
data0.describe()
{{< /highlight >}}

|	|vari|skew|kurtosis|entropy|class|
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|	count	|	1372.000000	|	1372.000000	|	1372.000000	|	1372.000000	|	1372.000000	|
|	mean	|	0.433735	|	1.922353	|	1.397627	|	-1.191657	|	0.444606	|
|	std	|	2.842763	|	5.869047	|	4.310030	|	2.101013	|	0.497103	|
|	min	|	-7.042100	|	-13.773100	|	-5.286100	|	-8.548200	|	0.000000	|
|	25%	|	-1.773000	|	-1.708200	|	-1.574975	|	-2.413450	|	0.000000	|
|	50%	|	0.496180	|	2.319650	|	0.616630	|	-0.586650	|	0.000000	|
|	75%	|	2.821475	|	6.814625	|	3.179250	|	0.394810	|	1.000000	|
|	max	|	6.824800	|	12.951600	|	17.927400	|	2.449500	|	1.000000	|

Negative values can be noticed in the variance and entropy, whereas it is
theoretically impossible, so it can be deduced that some preprocessing
operations were already performed.


We are trying to detect forged banknotes thanks to the extracted features.
The dataset contains 1372 observations, including 610 forged banknotes, so
roughly 45%. The two classes are balanced in the data, which might be relevant
for some algorithms. Indeed, a higher proportion of a category in the
characteristic of interest (here whether the banknote is genuine or not) yields
a higher **prior probability** for that outcome in Bayesian reasoning.

## Kernel Density Estimation for each variable by class

KDE are powerful tools to understand how 1-dimensional data are distributed.
The estimate can also be split by class to find differences in the
distributions. Using ggplot and the pandas `groupby` method, the
plots can be generated and saved as such:

{{< highlight python >}}
for v in data0.columns[:4]:
ggplot.ggsave(
  ggplot.ggplot(ggplot.aes(x=v, color='class'),data=data0)+
  ggplot.geom_density()+
  ggplot.geom_point(ggplot.aes(y=0),alpha=0.2)+
  ggplot.labs(title='KDE '+v,x=v,y="KDE"),
  'KDE_'+v+'.png',width=18,height=12)
{{< /highlight >}}

![](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/KDE_entropy.png)
![](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/KDE_Vari.png)
![](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/KDE_skew.png)
![](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/KDE_kurtosis.png)

Using this first simple visualization technique, we can deduce that the
variance may be much more efficient to separate the two banknotes
categories than the Kurtosis.

## Visualizing variable combinations with scatter plots

We generate a color list using for-comprehension:

{{< highlight python >}}
col = list('r' if i==1 else 'b' for i in data0["class"])
pd.tools.plotting.scatter_matrix(data0.ix[:,:4],figsize=(6,3),
color=col,diagonal='kde')
{{< /highlight >}}

![Scatter matrix: red dots represent the class "1"](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/scatter_matrix.png)

A scatter plot is the most straight-forward way to understand intuitive and
obvious patterns in the data. It is especially efficient when the number of
variables and classes is limited, such as our data set. It allows us to
understand class-dependent, non-linear relationships between variables.

This is much more efficient than a simple statistic, such as the correlation
coefficient which would not have found the skewness and entropy to be related.
From these rather strong relationships between variables, we now know that
some techniques based on independent features might not be efficient here.

##  Testing a distribution with Quantile-Quantile plots

{{< highlight python >}}
# Subsetting the data by class
d0 = data0[data0["class"]==0]
d1 = data0[data0["class"]==1]

# For each variable
for v in data0.columns[:4]:
#set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(9,4))
# define two subplots
ax1 =  plt.subplot(121)
# compute the quantile-quantile plot with normal distribution
stats.probplot(d0[v],dist='norm',plot=plt)
# add title
plt.title("Normal QQ-plot "+v + " - Class 0")
ax2 = plt.subplot(122)
stats.probplot(d1[v],dist='norm',plot=plt)
plt.title("Normal QQ-plot "+v + " - Class 1")
plt.savefig("qqplot_"+v+".png",width=700,height=250)
plt.show()
{{< /highlight >}}

![QQplot entropy](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/qqplot_entropy.png)
![QQplot skewness](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/qqplot_skew.png)
![QQplot variance](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/qqplot_vari.png)
![QQplot kurtosis](/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/qqplot_kurtosis.png)

Even though some variables are quite far from normally distributed, the
hypothesis would be acceptable for some model-based learning algorithms using
properties of Gaussian variables.

## Non-parametric distribution with boxplots

Boxplots represent the data using 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles which can be
more robust than mean and variance. The pandas library offers a quick method
and plotting tool to represent boxplots for each class and variable. It
highlights the differences in the spread of the data.

{{< highlight python >}}
data0.groupby("class").boxplot(figsize=(9,5))
{{< /highlight >}}

![Boxplot representation](/static/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/Boxplot.png)

This will be useful in the next part, when the data will be transformed to
enhance the performance and robustness of predictive models.

So see you in the next part for feature engineering!
