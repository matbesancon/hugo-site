I am a researcher in mathematical optimization with interests in nonlinear and discrete problems, and an emphasis on formulations and computational approaches.  

**TL;DR**: I write mathematical models that represent decision-making processes or equilibria within systems, and build abstract algorithms and concrete computer programs that provide solutions to these models with guarantees.  

I joined the [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) Institute in Grenoble in January 2024 as a Tenured Associate Researcher (*Chargé de Recherche*) working with the [Polaris](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/) group at the [Grenoble Computer Science Lab](https://www.liglab.fr/en). Broadly speaking, we work on decision and learning in uncertain, unknown, dynamic contexts, potentially with multiple agents. If what the group and/or what I do sounds like fun, feel free to [contact me](#contact) or check some [example topics](workwithme).  
  

My research interests span the theory, methods, and algorithms for several flavours of mathematical optimization.
More specifically, I have been interested in exact solution methods for constrained optimization with constraint structures we can exploit.
Those include solution methods, computational models, and software in mixed-integer (non-)linear and convex optimization and in particular
around the [SCIP](https://scipopt.org) framework and Frank-Wolfe related approaches.
I have been exploring applications of these classes of problems in power systems, quantum information, systems biology, networks and infrastructure, and data science & machine learning.  
    
I graduated with a double PhD (*cotutelle*) from
[Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and
Centrale Lille, at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/inocs)
& the [Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en) lab, in mathematical optimization.
My thesis focused on bilevel optimization, an extension
coined *near-optimality robustness*, and pricing for demand response in smart grids.
It was co-supervised by Luce Brotcorne (Inria) & Miguel F. Anjos (University of Edinburgh).
I spent some time in Berlin as a researcher at the [Zuse Institute](https://www.zib.de/).
  
I am involved in several open-source projects around optimization and scientific computing
in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language and around [JuMP](https://jump.dev).
I worked with and in various industries, from a hardware startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) in France with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en) in Germany and Polytechnique Montreal.
  
On a personal note, I read both fiction (mostly history, detective, thrillers and fantasy)
and non-fiction books (on economic policy, education, transportation systems, the energy transition);
a more detailed readling list can be found on my [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110133896).
I also enjoy games in various formats (tabletop, video, board, card) and cooking (from fermentation attempts to pasta recipes and coffee brewing).
